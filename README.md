## Used Software

- To create the LibGDX project the original [LibGDX Setup App](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) was used
- To edit the Java code and run/debug it [Eclipse Java Oxygen](https://www.eclipse.org/oxygen/) was used in combination with Java 6 (because of LibGdx the version number is this low)
- To create the bounding maps for the box2D physics the [box2d-editor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/box2d-editor/downloads) was used
- To create the Bitmap fonts the program [Hiero](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/tools.html) was used
